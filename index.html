          The best way to get comfortable with handling a soccer ball is to practice juggling.  When in a park or on the sidewalk,
          just grab the soccer ball and practice bouncing it on the foot. Ball control helps when on the field and you become one 
          with the ball and field. This is how you become maneuverable.

          Conditioning is important when looking to play soccer and better your skills. To maximize your benefits, sprint 200 paces, then
          walk 200 paces, 5 times.  Then do 100 paces.  Then do 50 paces. Then do 20 paces.  In the end, you will be well prepared for 
          stopping and going on the soccer field.

          And breathe.  The practice of breathing helps with managing yourself throughout the game and life.
          Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
          Have a great day on the soccer field!
